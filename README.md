## coldTABs

  

This project is a Google Chrome Extension I called coldTABs

  

## Purpose

-   The goal of this project “coldTABs” is to solve the common problem we all have—too many open tabs!
    

  

## How it Works

-   Install on your Google Chrome Extension Browser
    
-   Pin to the extension bar
    
-   Click on the icon to collapse all open tabs to coldTABs where they will be saved in a list
    
-   If you need to recover any tab, just head to the list in coldTABs and click to recover
